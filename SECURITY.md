## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues can be reported privately by sending an email to this Gmail account: `jquery.ui.drupal.fork.tests`.
The message or subject must include `security-report`. These messages will be checked daily. We will respond within
48 hours to confirm we've received the report and with any additional questions. A response will also be provided if we
determine a reported issue does not need to be addressed.

If a vulnerability is reported and it is confirmed that changes are neccessary, the maintainer will 
coordinate a new release with the Drupal security team. Specific turnaround times are dependent on 
the nature of the issue reported, but the coordination process will begin as soon as there is 
confirmation of a valid issue that needs to be addressed.
